The best place to start with Ionic is our [documentation page](http://ionicframework.com/docs/).

Note: Ionic currently best supports iOS 6+ and Android 4.1+, with limited support for Android 2.3. Ionic is changing quickly as we work towards the beta.

# What is Ionic?

Ionic is the open source HTML5 Mobile Framework for building amazing, cross-platform hybrid native apps with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Just like this one:

![Weather Demo](http://ionicframework.com/img/weather1x.png)

We built Ionic because we wanted a framework that focused on building hybrid native apps, rather than mobile websites. We wanted this framework to be obsessive about great design and performance. A framework that left the past behind and focused on the future where mobile devices could make HTML5 feel native.

It's important to realize that Ionic is not a replacement for frameworks used for building mobile web apps. There are a lot
of great solutions that work well for websites, like [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/).

Ionic is also not a good solution if you need to support older generation devices. Our [compatibility](http://ionicframework.com/docs/#browser-support) *starts* at iOS 6 and Android 4.1. We will never support versions earlier than those. This is a framework for the future.

## Quick Start

To start using ionic, you have two options: copy over the built JS and CSS files, or
use the `ionic` tool ([ionic-cli](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli)) which can be installed through npm:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

Then, you can start a new ionic project by running:

```bash
$ ionic start myproject
```

### Manual Start

- Download the latest **stable** release from:
  * The release folder of this repository
  * The Ionic CDN: [Latest Release](http://code.ionicframework.com/)
  * `bower install ionic` 
- Download the **bleeding edge just-from-master release** from:
  * The Ionic CDN: [Nightly Build](http://code.ionicframework.com/#nightly)
  * Look in the [ionic-bower Repository](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-bower) for the latest version, and do for example `bower install driftyco/ionic-bower#0.9.23-alpha-652` (`bower install ionic` will have the latest available soon)
  
Once you have a release, use `js/ionic.js`, `js/ionic-angular.js`, and `css/ionic.css`.

For most cases, you'll need AngularJS as well.  This is bundled in `js/angular/` and `js/angular-ui-router/`.

## Development

* `npm install && npm install -g gulp protractor` to setup
* `gulp` or `gulp build` to build
* `gulp docs` to generate docs (read Documentation below for how to test docs locally).
* `gulp build --release` to build with minification & strip debugs
* `gulp watch` to watch and rebuild on change
* `gulp karma` to test one-time
* `gulp karma-watch` to test and re-run on source change
* `gulp protractor` to test e2e tests locally
* `gulp cloudtest` to run e2e tests in the cloud

### Documentation

* To test documentation, follow these steps:
  1. Clone ionic-site to `./tmp/ionic-site` - this is where the `gulp docs` task builds to.  `./tmp` is the folder that travis uses to do all of its tasks.
    - `mkdir tmp && git clone git@github.com:driftyco/ionic-site tmp/ionic-site`
  2. Make jekyll rebuild whenever you change the site.
    - `cd tmp/ionic-site && jekyll serve -w`
  3. Go back to project root and build the docs
    - `gulp docs`
  4. Open localhost:4000 and see your changes! Re-run `gulp docs` again whenever you change something, and jekyll will update the site.

### Commit Conventions

* Uses http://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog conventions

### Pushing New Release of Ionic

- Almost all of the logic for releasing Ionic is done on the Travis server
- To push a new release:
  1. Update package.json version to new version
  2. Update package.json codename to new codename
  3. Generate changelog with `gulp changelog` and make sure it is OK
  4. Commit these and push to master
- Travis will detect that this commit changed the version in package.json and push out all necessary for this new release (tags, release files, site config, ...)
